So I guess you want to know more about what makes this site tick, huh?

{:.text--body}
It's undergoing an open redesign and is a [work in progress](https://trello.com/b/yFbZFW3E), so if it looks strange, that's why.

{:.text--body}
It's built on top of [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site compiler powered by the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating engine. This site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

{:.heading--primary}
### Design and Concept

{:.text--body}
I designed the initial concept for the site and its sitemap in [Sketch 3](https://www.sketchapp.com/).


{:.heading--primary}
### CSS

{:.text--body}
No frameworks were used in the creation of this site. I did use [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to help me with my CSS workflow and to create the responsive grid used in each of the pages. I also derived my own boilerplate from [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/), which I now use with most of my projects. I used [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) along with some of [my own custom animations](http://codepen.io/emsky/pen/RRjPGg) to breathe life into some of the elements.

### Tools

{:.text--body}
I update and keep track of this project's progress with [Trello](https://trello.com/b/yFbZFW3E). For my local environment, I used [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to automatically compile the Sass files, with [Livereload](http://livereload.com/) setup to work with the [XCode iOS Simulator](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/iOS_Simulator_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html) . My choice of IDE? Why, [Atom](https://atom.io/), of course &mdash; configured with [Terminal Plus](https://atom.io/packages/terminal-plus), [Emmet](http://emmet.io/) and [Power Mode](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode).

{:.heading--primary}
### Images

{:.text--body}
To make the images adaptive, I wrote a custom script that points the page to the appropriate image based on the size of the screen. I own most of the images used on this site, except for the [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) animation used in my [404 page](/404.html).

{:.heading--primary}
### Typography and Icons

{:.text--body}
Typography-wise, I used [Work Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Work+Sans) by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) for my body copy and [Calendas Plus](http://calendasplus.com/) by [Atipo](http://atipo.es/tipografia/) for stylized text. For icon fonts, I have [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for UI icons and [Technology Icons](http://websiddu.github.io/technology-icons/).

{:.text--body}
My [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) documents are parsed with [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/).

{:.text--body}
Twenty seven. That's the number of coffees consumed so far in the course of this project.
