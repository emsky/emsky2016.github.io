### Redesigning the Enterprise Experience

#### Overview

In October 2016, I joined ePLDT’s Experience Creation Team and PLDT’s Disruptive Business Group.

During the two years, I helped the team define its very own process and launched multiple experiments on the AARRR funnels of the company’s products and solutions. I helped ePLDT tackle tough challenges such as designing customer and employee experiences, bridging the gap between user experience and data security, establishing design strategies for cross-functional teams and advocating design as the ultimate differentiator for enterprise solutions.

This experience helped me learn new design methodologies and strategy frameworks which refined my overall comprehension of user experience and product design for the digital medium.
