<h1 id="aselle">Aselle</h1>

<p>Aselle is a custom Jekyll theme I built for my personal website.</p>

<p>Here are some of the custom page variables I added to the mix:</p>

<pre><code>masthead_src
</code></pre>

<p>Relative path to the image used for the page masthead or banner. There should be three versions of the same image, using <code>@sm</code>, <code>@md</code> and <code>@lg</code>, for mobile, tablet and large screens respectively. Use the <code>@md</code> version as the default src.</p>

<h3 id="imagesareadaptive">Images are Adaptive</h3>

<p>To make the masthead and inline images responsive and adaptive, I wrote a custom JS function that replaces the image source with one that&#8217;s appropriate for the screen size and resolution. This is triggered on page load and when the window is resized.</p>

<p>Images are handled through art direction. I, personally, don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s a perfect responsive or adaptive image strategy. The best one is always a mix of both art direction and media queries.</p>
